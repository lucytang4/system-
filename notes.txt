Aim: A pipe by any other name

Named Pipes

   Also known as FIFOs

   Same as unnamed pipes except FIFOs have a name that can be used to identify them via different programs

   Like unnamed pipes, FIFOs are unidirectional

   mkfifo

      Shell command to make a FIFO

      $ mkfifo <pipe name>

   mkfifo - <sys/types.h> <sys/stat.h>

      c function to create a FIFO

      Returns 0 on success and -1 on failure

      Once created, the FIFO acts like a regular file, and we can use open, read, write, and close on it

      mkfifo(<name>, <permissions>)

      FIFOs will block on open until both ends of the pipe have a connection

Server/Client Program Paradigms
   
   Handshake

      A procedure to ensure that a connection has been established

      Both ends of the connection must verify that they can send and receive data to and from each other

      Basic Handshake Procedure:

         1) Server creates a FIFO (Well Known Pipe)

         2) Server waits for a connection

         3) Client creates a "private" FIFO

         4) Client connects to server and sends the private FIFO name

         5) Client waits for a message from the server

         6) Server receives client's message and removes the WKP

         7) Server connects to client FIFO, sending an intial acknowledgement message

         8) Client receives server's message, removes its private FIFO

Do Now: What is needed in order for 2 computers to communicate with each other?
Identification, Physical Connection, Send/Recieve Data, Security, Data Packaging/Message Composition, Connection Verification, User Interaction

OSI 7-Layer Model

   Used to help conceptualize the different parts of network connections

   The top layer is the most concrete, with each subsequent layer becoming more abstract (relying less on the physical connections and more on code)

   The Layers

      1. Physical

      2. Data Link

      3. Network

      4. Transport

      5. Session

      6. Presentation

      7. Application

   If you are working on a particular layer, you should not have to think too much about the other layers

Physical Layer

   How computers are physically connected

   Things like electrons running across wires, radio signals pulsing through the air...

   A brief history of wired connections

      Thicknet

         A single Coaxial cable runs throughout the network, "vampire taps" go into the cable and leech the data out

      Thinnet

         A single Coaxial cable runs throughout the network, T-Junctions used to splice connections

      In Thicknet and Thinnet, all data is sent to all computers

      Each computer added increases the power drain on the entire system, degrading service

Aim: Cisco in an hour Part II: Electric Boogaloo

   Token Ring

      Each computer is connected in a ring to each other

      Only one computer has command of network resources at a time. This is called "having the token"

      The network sends a "token" throughout the ring, which contains the identity of the computer allowed to use the network. All other computers must wait to use the network

      No possibility of collisions

   Ethernet

      Multiple computers connect to a single hub or switch

      Hub

         Broadcasts the data to all computers

      Switch

         Sends data to a specific computer

      The more computers you add to an ethernet network the greater the chance of collisions

Data Link Layer

   Point-to-point transmission between devices on the same local network

   Ethernet Connections:

      Each device is given a unique 6-Byte MAC (Media Access Control) address, this is set on each network card when it is made

Aim: Cisco in an hour III: In 3-D!

      Data is packaged into frames

         Ethernet Frame:

            <prefix><dest><source><...><data><checksum>
	       8B     6B     6B    6B  46-1500B  4B

            prefix: 10101010 X7 + 10101011

            destination/source: MAC addresses

            ...: Information about frame type

            checksum: to ensure data integrity

         MTU

            Maximum Transmission Unit

            1500 Bytes for ethernet

Aim: Cisco in an hour IV: A New Hope

Network Layer

   Transmission of data between two separate networks

   Is not concerned with whether or not data was sent successfully (connectionless)

   Major features of this layer are addressing, routing, and packet fowarding

   IP (internet protocol) addresses

      IPv4: 4 byte address

         [0-255].[0-255].[0-255].[0-255]

      Routing is made easier by having IP addresses distributed in blocks

Aim: Cisco in an hour Part V: V for Vendetta

Network Layer

   blah


    Data is broken into packets (IPv4)
        header info: packet type (IPv4/6), header length...
        fragment info: full payloads may be broken up, this will have total # of fragments, which fragment...
        time-to-live: max # of hops before the packet dies
        protocol: TCP/UDP/...
        header checksum: checksum of header bytes (exclude source/dest)
        source and destination: IP addesses
        ...: optional information depending on protocol, type etc
    IPv6
        Problem with IPv4 is that we are running out of usable IPv4 IP addresses
        Biggest difference is the address space goes from 2^32 --> 2^128
        Addresses are written as 8 groups of 4 hexadecimal digits
            87ab : 301c : a45d : 2143 : ff87 : abcd : dead : feed
            leading 0s are ignored, consecutive 0-groups can be replaced with ::, but only once in an address
            :: ffff : 149.89.150.100
        smallest range of IPv6 is equivalent to an IPv4 IP addresss
        Jumbograms
            Increases the MTU to ~4.3 billion (2^32)
        Other improvements in IPv6 make the protocol incompatible with IPv4.

Aim: Cisco in an hour VI: The Undiscovered Country

Transport Layer

   Computer to computer connection over a network

   Unconcerned with the individual hops of layer 3 traffic

   Each destination address has multiple ports

      65,535 ports

      Each port corresponds to a particular service

      ports < 1024 are well known, reserved ports

      Regulated by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)

   TCP

      Transmission Control Protol

      Reliable connection

      Guarantees delivery of data

      Data is considered a continuous stream that arrives in the order it is sent (which may not be true in the network layer)

      Connections are established using a 3-way handshake

         Server "binds" to a port and waits

         1. Client sends a SYN message to the server

         2. Server sends the client a SYN_ACK message

         3. Client sends an ACK message to the server

   UDP

      User Data Protocol

      Does not require an explicit connection

      Data is sent as discrete datagrams with a set size (as opposed to a continuous stream)

      Datagrams may be dropped or received out of order

      Assumes that any kind of error checking is handled at a later level
