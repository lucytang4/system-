Aim: a pipe by any other name

Named Pipes
   Also known as FIFOs

   Same as unnamed pipes except FIFOs have a name that can be used to identify them via different programs

   Like unnamed pipes, FIFOs are unidirectional

   mkfifo

      Shell command to make a FIFO

      $ mkfifo <pipe name>

   mkfifo - <sys/types.h> <sys/stat.h>

      c function to create a FIFO

      Returns 0 on success and -1 on failure

      Once created, the FIFO acts like a regular file, and we can use open, read, write, and close on it

      mkfifo(<name>, <permissions>)

      FIFOs will block on open until both ends of the pipe have a connection
